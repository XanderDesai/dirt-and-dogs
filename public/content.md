# What is Dirt and Dogs?
Dirt and Dogs is a community mountain bike ride and cookout. Our goal is help mountain bikers in Livingston County build connections with each other and enjoy their sport together.

The Dirt: As a home base of operations we ride the trails at the Brighton Recreation area.

The Dogs: After the ride we have a cookout in the park. Use it as a chance to get to know your fellow riders. Hot dogs will be provided. Bringing food to share with others is always welcome.
